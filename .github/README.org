* Sean's Dotfiles

An always evolving repo of my settings. My ultimate goal is to minimize the code
in this repo as much as possible by upstreaming my settings.

OS targets are =MacOS= and =Linux=. Ideally, I'd just be running Emacs as my OS
:-)

** Ensure secrets are setup

This is only needed for our main machine. All other hosts should not have access
to our bitwarden vault.

#+begin_src
/usr/bin/security find-internet-password -w -a sean@farley.io -s bitwarden.farley.io
#+end_src

** Bootstrap yadm

#+begin_src
git clone https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm.git ~/.local/share/yadm-project
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s ~/.local/share/yadm-project/yadm ~/.local/bin/yadm
#+end_src

This might fail on a fresh install of MacOS since the command-line tools need to
be installed. That's fine. You should be prompted to install them and then can
re-run this command.

** Initialize yadm

#+begin_src
~/.local/bin/yadm clone --bootstrap https://github.com/seanfarley/dotfiles
#+end_src
