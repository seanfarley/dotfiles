* Sean's Dotfiles

An always evolving repo of my settings. My ultimate goal is to minimize the code
in this repo as much as possible by upstreaming my settings.

OS targets are =MacOS= and =Linux=. Ideally, I'd just be running Emacs as my OS
:-)

Basic usuage:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./bootstrap
./osx
#+END_SRC

Since this repo is cobbled together from many other users' ideas, feel free to
do the same for mine.
