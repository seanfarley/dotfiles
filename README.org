* Sean's Dotfiles

An always evolving repo of my settings. My ultimate goal is to minimize the code
in this repo as much as possible by upstreaming my settings.

OS targets are =MacOS= and =Linux=. Ideally, I'd just be running Emacs as my OS
:-)

** Ensure secrets are setup

#+begin_src
/usr/bin/security find-internet-password -w -a sean@farley.io -s bitwarden.farley.io
#+end_src

** Bootstrap Chezmoi

#+begin_src
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi) -b ~/.local/bin"
#+end_src

This might fail on a fresh install of MacOS since the command-line tools need to
be installed. That's fine. You should be prompted to install them and then can
re-run this command.

** Initialize Chezmoi

#+begin_src
~/.local/bin/chezmoi -S ~/projects/dotfiles init seanfarley/dotfiles --apply
#+end_src
